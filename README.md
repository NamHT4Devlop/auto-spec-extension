## 💡 Why Auto Spec Kit?

Traditional AI coding assistants answer one question at a time. Auto Spec Kit runs a **complete, multi-step workflow** for each task:

| Without Auto Spec Kit | With Auto Spec Kit |
|---|---|
| Manually prompt Copilot for a plan | 13-step pipeline runs automatically |
| No code review | Multi-agent review: security + architecture + performance + business |
| No tests written | Test scaffolding generated for every task |
| No documentation | Evidence files saved with every session |
| AI has no project context | Knowledge Base grows with every task |
| Single AI perspective | Multiple parallel sub-agents for deeper analysis |

---

## 📦 Requirements

- **VS Code** `^1.93.0`
- **GitHub Copilot** subscription (individual or business)
- **GitHub Copilot Chat** extension installed and active
- Node.js (for local development / building from source)

> Auto Spec Kit uses the `vscode.lm` API to call GitHub Copilot directly inside VS Code — **no Anthropic, OpenAI, or other API keys needed**.

---

## 🔧 Installation

### From VSIX (recommended)

1. Download `auto-spec-kit-1.8.0.vsix`
2. Open VS Code → Extensions panel (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
3. Click **⋯ → Install from VSIX…**
4. Select the downloaded file
5. Reload VS Code when prompted

### From Source

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd auto-spec-extension
npm install
npm run compile
npm run package
# Install the generated .vsix:
code --install-extension auto-spec-kit-1.8.0.vsix
```

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

1. **Install** the extension (see above)
2. Open any project in VS Code
3. Open **Copilot Chat** panel → type `@autospec /scan` → Scan project & generate Knowledge Base
4. Then type `@autospec /build Add email verification to user registration`
5. Watch the 13-step multi-agent pipeline run

Or use keyboard shortcuts: `Cmd+Shift+B` (Scan), `Cmd+Shift+K` (Build).

---

## 🤖 Usage — Copilot Chat (`@autospec`)

**This is the primary way to use Auto Spec Kit.** Open the Copilot Chat panel in VS Code and type:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `@autospec /build Add reset password feature` | Build a feature — full 13-step pipeline |
| `@autospec /scan` | Scan the project — generate Knowledge Base |
| `@autospec /rescan` | Rescan latest changes — update Knowledge Base |
| `@autospec /review` | Review current file — security, architecture, performance |
| `@autospec /ask How does auth work?` | Ask about codebase — Q&A powered by KB |
| `@autospec /plan User onboarding redesign...` | Plan user stories — Epic → Sprint Plan (PO/BA) |
| `@autospec /map` | Map the codebase — interactive dependency graph |

### Free text (no slash command)

```
@autospec Which module handles payment processing?
```

If you don't use a slash command, your message is treated as `/ask` — a question about the codebase answered from the Knowledge Base.

### How it works

When you type `@autospec`, VS Code routes your message to the Auto Spec Kit **Chat Participant**. The extension:

1. Reads your slash command (e.g., `/build`, `/scan`, `/review`)
2. Resolves the best available Copilot model
3. Runs the corresponding workflow (with multi-agent orchestration where applicable)
4. Streams progress and results directly into the chat panel
5. Saves full outputs to `spec-kit-sessions/` and/or `knowledge-base/`

### Example session

## 🔬 Deep Dive: `/build` — 13-Step Pipeline

When you type `@autospec /build Add reset password feature using email OTP, expires after 10 minutes`, this is exactly what happens:

### Input

You provide **one line** — a task description. The extension handles everything else.

### Pipeline Steps

```
Step 01  Planning ─────────────── 3 parallel agents analyze your codebase
Step 02  Plan Review ──────────── 2 agents validate feasibility + business alignment
Step 03  Plan Feedback ────────── ⏸ YOU review the plan, add comments
Step 04  Code Generation ──────── N parallel generators (one per module)
Step 05  Code Review ──────────── 4 agents: Security + Architecture + Performance + Business
Step 06  Code Feedback ────────── ⏸ YOU review the code, request changes
Step 07  Write Tests ──────────── 3 agents: Unit + Integration + Edge Case
Step 08  Test Review ──────────── 2 agents: Coverage + Quality
Step 09  Test Feedback ────────── ⏸ YOU review tests, add comments
Step 10  Save & Apply ─────────── Extract files, write to project
Step 11  Execute Tests ────────── Run your test command, capture results
Step 12  Evidence Collection ──── 2 agents: Technical + Business evidence
Step 13  Update KB ────────────── 2 agents: Technical Delta + Business Delta
```

### Step-by-step detail

**Step 01 — Planning (3 agents in parallel)**

Your requirement triggers 3 sub-agents that run simultaneously:

| Agent | Role | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Codebase Analyzer | Scans project via SmartContextLoader | Discovers which files, classes, and modules are relevant to the task |
| Impact Detector | Traces dependencies | Identifies all files that will be affected by the change (direct + transitive) |
| Business Flow Tracer | Reads Knowledge Base | Maps existing business flows that interact with the change area |

A **merge agent** then combines the 3 outputs into a unified implementation plan.

**Example for "Add reset password feature":**
- Codebase Analyzer → finds `auth.service.ts`, `user.repository.ts`, `email.service.ts`, existing password change flow
- Impact Detector → identifies `auth.controller.ts` needs new endpoint, `user.entity.ts` needs OTP fields, `auth.module.ts` needs new provider
- Business Flow Tracer → maps existing login flow, token refresh flow, identifies where reset intersects

**Step 02 — Plan Review (2 agents)**

| Agent | Focus |
|---|---|
| Technical Feasibility | Can this plan actually be implemented? Are there dependency conflicts? Missing prerequisites? |
| Business Alignment | Does the plan match the requirement? Are there business rules being violated? |

**Step 03 — Plan Feedback (human checkpoint)**

The pipeline pauses and shows you the plan. You can:
- ✅ Approve and continue
- ✏️ Add comments ("also add rate limiting on the OTP endpoint")
- ❌ Cancel the pipeline

**Step 04 — Code Generation (N parallel generators)**

The plan is split into **work units** — one per module/file. Each work unit gets its own code generator agent running in parallel:

```
Work Unit 1: auth.controller.ts  → Agent generates POST /reset-password, POST /verify-otp
Work Unit 2: auth.service.ts     → Agent generates resetPassword(), verifyOtp(), generateOtp()
Work Unit 3: user.entity.ts      → Agent adds otpCode, otpExpiresAt fields
Work Unit 4: email.service.ts    → Agent generates sendOtpEmail()
Work Unit 5: auth.module.ts      → Agent wires new providers
```

All agents share the same context (plan + KB + relevant source files) but generate code independently.

**Step 05 — Code Review (4 agents in parallel)**

The generated code is reviewed by 4 specialized agents simultaneously:

| Agent | Checks |
|---|---|
| 🔒 Security | SQL injection, XSS, auth bypass, OTP brute-force protection, timing attacks |
| 🏗 Architecture | Layer violations, coupling, DI patterns, SOLID principles |
| ⚡ Performance | N+1 queries, missing indexes, memory leaks, unnecessary allocations |
| 🏢 Business Consistency | Cross-references `13-business-rules.md` — validates domain rules intact |

**Step 06 — Code Feedback (human checkpoint)**

Pipeline pauses. You review the generated code + review findings. Approve, request fixes, or cancel.

**Step 07 — Write Tests (3 agents in parallel)**

| Agent | Generates |
|---|---|
| Unit Tests | Tests for each function/method in isolation, mocking dependencies |
| Integration Tests | Tests for API endpoints, database interactions, service-to-service calls |
| Edge Case / Security | Boundary values, expired OTP, invalid tokens, brute-force scenarios |

**Step 08 — Test Review (2 agents)**

| Agent | Focus |
|---|---|
| Coverage Analyzer | Are all code paths covered? Missing branches? Uncovered error handlers? |
| Quality Reviewer | Are tests maintainable? Proper assertions? No false positives? |

**Step 09 — Test Feedback (human checkpoint)**

Review tests. Approve or request changes.

**Step 10 — Save & Apply**

Files are extracted from generated markdown and written to your project. You choose:
- ✅ Apply to project now → files written to workspace
- 📁 Save in session folder only → non-destructive

**Step 11 — Execute Tests**

Runs your configured `autoSpecKit.testCommand` (e.g., `npx jest --coverage`). Captures stdout, stderr, exit code. If tests fail, Copilot analyzes failures and suggests fixes.

**Step 12 — Evidence Collection (2 agents)**

| Agent | Produces |
|---|---|
| Technical Evidence | Summary of all code changes, architecture decisions, test results |
| Business Evidence | How the change affects business flows, what was validated, risk assessment |

Saved as `evidence.md` in the session folder — ready for code review, sprint review, or audit.

**Step 13 — Rescan & Update Knowledge Base (2 agents)**

| Agent | Updates |
|---|---|
| Technical Delta | Updates architecture, API contracts, tech stack KB files with new information |
| Business Delta | Updates business rules, core flows, domain model KB files |

This is how the KB **gets smarter over time** — each completed task enriches the knowledge for future tasks.

### Output

After the pipeline completes, your session folder contains:

```

## 📖 Detailed Workflows

### 1. Scan Project (Knowledge Base)

**Chat:** `@autospec /scan` | **Shortcut:** `Ctrl+Shift+B` / `Cmd+Shift+B`

Scans your entire project and generates a comprehensive Knowledge Base — 15 Markdown files covering every aspect of the codebase at **business depth**.

Uses **batch parallelism** (5 batches × 3 parallel agents). Critical business steps get additional sub-agents for deeper analysis.

**Source-only mode:** If a KB already exists, `/scan` offers a QuickPick choice — rebuild from source code only (skips README, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG, `docs/`, `.github/`, etc.) or regenerate with docs included. Useful when existing documentation is outdated. See [Source-Only KB Scan Mode](#source-only-kb-scan-mode) for details.

| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `01-project-overview.md` | Architecture, tech stack, project purpose |
| `02-tech-stack.md` | Libraries, frameworks, why each was chosen |
| `03-project-structure.md` | Folder layout, module boundaries, layer rules |
| `04-domain-model.md` | Core entities, relationships, domain concepts |
| `05-api-contracts.md` | REST/GraphQL endpoints, request/response shapes |
| `06-auth-security.md` | Auth flows, guards, permission model |
| `07-data-layer.md` | DB schema, migrations, ORM patterns |
| `08-integrations.md` | External services, queues, webhooks |
| `09-config-envvars.md` | Environment variables, feature flags, constants |
| `10-core-flows.md` | Key business workflows end-to-end |
| `11-error-handling.md` | Error types, HTTP codes, error propagation |
| `12-testing-strategy.md` | Test coverage, patterns, test data setup |
| `13-business-rules.md` | Business invariants, validations, constraints |
| `14-performance-scalability.md` | Bottlenecks, caching, scaling patterns |
| `15-tech-debt.md` | Known issues, TODOs, areas needing attention |

---

### 2. Review Current File

**Chat:** `@autospec /review` | **Access:** Right-click → **Auto Spec Kit: Review Current File**

Multi-agent code review with 4 parallel reviewers (Security, Architecture, Performance, Business Consistency). Cross-references your Knowledge Base for business rule validation.

---

### 3. Rescan Latest Changes

**Chat:** `@autospec /rescan` | **Access:** Command Palette

Merges learnings from manual work back into the KB. Useful when you complete tasks outside the `/build` pipeline.

---

### 4. Ask About Codebase

**Chat:** `@autospec /ask <question>` or just `@autospec <question>`

Natural language Q&A grounded in the Knowledge Base. Examples:
- `@autospec /ask How does order cancellation work?`
- `@autospec Which services call the payment gateway?`
- `@autospec What environment variables are required?`

---

### 5. Plan User Stories (PO/BA)

**Chat:** `@autospec /plan <epic description>` | **Shortcut:** `Ctrl+Shift+U`

A 7-step AI pipeline for PO/BA that requires only 2 inputs (Epic title + description):

| Step | What happens |
|---|---|
| 1. KB Investigation | 3 agents scan KB for domain context, existing flows, constraints |
| 2. Feature Discovery | AI auto-discovers features from epic description + KB context |
| 3. Impact Analysis | Per-feature: maps old business flow vs. new flow |
| 4. Confirmation Checklist | Generates questions to confirm with stakeholders |
| 5. User Story Generation | Per-feature parallel story writing |
| 6. Sprint Planning | Groups stories into sprints by dependency and priority |
| 7. HTML Report | Interactive sprint board with filters |

**Example:**
```
@autospec /plan User Onboarding Redesign: Simplify registration, add social login 
(Google, GitHub), implement email verification with OTP, create guided setup wizard.
```

---

### 6. Map Codebase (Dependency Graph)

**Chat:** `@autospec /map` | **Access:** Command Palette

Generates an interactive D3.js force-directed graph of your project. Supports **9 programming languages** (TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, Go, Ruby, C#, PHP, Rust).

Two phases:
1. **Static scan** — file imports, class hierarchy, method calls, API routes, decorators
2. **AI enrichment** (optional) — 3 agents: Flow Tracer, Entity Mapper, Architecture Validator

Click any node in the graph → opens the source file in VS Code.

---

### 7. Select Model

**Chat:** N/A | **Access:** Command Palette → `Auto Spec Kit: Select Model`

Browse available GitHub Copilot models. Selection saved to settings.

---

## 🧠 Multi-Agent Architecture (v1.7.0)

v1.7.0 introduces **parallel sub-agents** for deeper analysis. Instead of one Copilot call per step, critical steps spawn multiple specialized agents that work simultaneously.

### Core infrastructure

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `AgentOrchestrator` | Runs N agents in parallel with concurrency control, timeout, and 3 merge strategies |
| `SmartContextLoader` | File Discovery Agent selects relevant files; builds per-agent token-budgeted context |
| `TokenBudget` | Estimates tokens, allocates budget by priority, auto-truncates to fit model limits |

### Merge strategies

| Strategy | How it works | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| `ai` | A merge agent synthesizes all outputs into one coherent document | Planning, evidence |
| `concat` | Simple concatenation with headers | Code generation, tests |
| `structured` | Section-based merge with deduplication | Reviews, KB updates |

### Configuration

```jsonc
{
  "autoSpecKit.agents.maxParallel": 3,        // 1-6 parallel agents per step
  "autoSpecKit.agents.timeout": 90000,         // Per-agent timeout (ms)
  "autoSpecKit.agents.mergeStrategy": "ai",    // ai | concat | structured
  "autoSpecKit.agents.contextStrategy": "smart" // smart | full | minimal
}
```

---

## 🧠 Adaptive Intelligence (v1.8.0)

v1.8.0 introduces 5 systems that make Auto Spec Kit smarter over time and work across any project structure.

### `/help` — Context-Aware Status

`@autospec /help` now shows a live dashboard: KB status, model info, project profile, learnings count, workspace type, and `.autospec.yml` detection — all at a glance.

### SessionMemory — No Context Lost

Long chat sessions in Copilot truncate early messages. `SessionMemory` persists key decisions, milestones, and the original requirement in `workspaceState`, injecting a rolling summary into every prompt. Auto-compacts at 30 entries to stay within token budget.

### RequirementClarifier — Handle Vague Inputs

Before running the 13-step pipeline, the `RequirementClarifier` scores your requirement across 4 dimensions (Specificity, Scope, Acceptance, Technical — 0-25 each). If the score is below 60, it asks targeted clarifying questions. In chat mode, questions appear inline; in Command Palette mode, via Quick Pick dialogs.

### ProjectProfile + LearningStore — Gets Smarter Over Time

`ProjectProfileDetector` auto-detects your stack (language, framework, build tool, test framework, linter, formatter, database, CI/CD, monorepo tool) by scanning project files. Cached in `.autospec/profile.json` for 24 hours.

`LearningStore` persists patterns from past sessions (code review fixes, test patterns, user preferences, conventions, architecture decisions, things to avoid) in `.autospec/learnings.json`. Duplicate learnings are reinforced (count incremented), and the top learnings are injected into every prompt — so the agent avoids past mistakes and follows your conventions.

### WorkspaceResolver — Any Repo Structure

Handles 4 workspace scenarios automatically:

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Single repo | Uses directly |
| Multi-root workspace | Shows picker to select folder |
| Monorepo (Nx, Turbo, Lerna, pnpm) | Detects packages, lets you scope to one |
| Folder of repos | Auto-discovers, shows picker |

### GitSyncGuard — Auto-Fetch/Pull Before Every Command

Before every command (except `/help`), the extension automatically syncs your workspace with the remote:

1. Runs `git fetch --all --prune`
2. Runs `git pull --ff-only` (fast-forward only — never creates merge commits)
3. Detects if source files changed after pull
4. If KB exists and source files changed, auto-runs KB update (via `updateKBStandalone`)

**Safety guarantees:**
- **NEVER** pushes, commits, or writes to the git remote — strictly read-only
- **Non-fatal** — sync failures do not block commands (works offline, works on non-git projects)

Configure via VS Code settings or `.autospec.yml`:

```jsonc
{
  "autoSpecKit.autoSync": true,          // enable/disable auto-fetch/pull
  "autoSpecKit.autoSyncKBUpdate": true   // auto-update KB when pulled code has source changes
}
```

### Source-Only KB Scan Mode

When scanning a project, you can choose to exclude existing documentation and generate the Knowledge Base purely from source code. This is useful when existing docs (README, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG, etc.) are outdated or misleading.

When a KB already exists, `/scan` presents a QuickPick:
- **Fresh rebuild — source code only** — excludes doc files/dirs, generates KB from code alone
- **Regenerate KB (include existing docs)** — standard full scan

Excluded in source-only mode:
- Files: `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `copilot-instructions.md`, etc.
- Directories: `docs/`, `doc/`, `.github/`, `.gitlab/`, `wiki/`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.mdx`, `.rst`, `.adoc`

Configure additional exclusions in `.autospec.yml`:

```yaml
scan:
  excludeDocs: true
  exclude:
    - "generated"
    - "vendor"
```

### `.autospec.yml` — Per-Project Config

Drop a `.autospec.yml` in your project root to override settings without touching VS Code config:

```yaml
language: java
testCommand: mvn test
knowledgeBasePath: docs/kb
sessionsDir: .autospec-sessions
ignore:
  - "*.generated.ts"
  - "dist/**"
autoSync:
  enabled: true
  kbUpdate: true
scan:
  excludeDocs: true
  exclude:
    - "generated"
    - "vendor"
```

Config priority: `.autospec.yml` > VS Code settings > defaults.

## 🔀 Git Context Integration

Code Review (Step 05) and Review File both load git context:
- Diff vs. default branch (`main`/`master`/`develop`)
- Working tree diff (uncommitted changes)
- Recent commit messages

---

## 🔄 Git Auto-Sync (GitSyncGuard)

Before every command (except `/help`), Auto Spec Kit ensures your workspace is up to date:

```
@autospec /build ...
  ├── git fetch --all --prune        ← fetch all remotes
  ├── git pull --ff-only             ← fast-forward merge only
  ├── detect changed source files    ← .ts, .py, .java, .go, etc.
  └── if KB exists + source changed  ← auto-update Knowledge Base
```

**What it does:**
- Fetches all remotes and prunes deleted branches
- Pulls using fast-forward only — never creates merge commits; if the branch has diverged, the pull is skipped
- Checks if any pulled changes touched source files (filters by extension, ignores `node_modules`, `dist`, etc.)
- If the Knowledge Base exists and source files changed, automatically triggers a KB update so your AI context stays fresh

**What it never does:**
- Never runs `git push`, `git commit`, or `git add`
- Never writes to the remote — all operations are strictly read-only
- Never blocks your command — sync failures are logged and skipped (works offline)

**Configuration:**

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `autoSpecKit.autoSync` | boolean | `true` | Enable/disable auto-fetch/pull before commands |
| `autoSpecKit.autoSyncKBUpdate` | boolean | `true` | Auto-update KB when pulled code has source changes |

In `.autospec.yml`:

```yaml
autoSync:
  enabled: true
  kbUpdate: true
```

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

- **Be specific** with `/build` — "Add JWT refresh token rotation with 7-day expiry" beats "add auth"
- **Scan first** (`@autospec /scan`) — the pipeline is significantly more accurate with KB context
- **Set `autoSpecKit.testCommand`** so Step 11 runs real tests
- **Use `/review` often** — the 4-agent review catches issues manual review misses
- For **complex tasks**, use `gpt-5.5` or `claude-opus-4-7`; for **fast iterations**, `o4-mini`
